 SINGAPORE: With South Korea's 4-1 loss to Brazil, all sides from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) have been eliminated from the World Cup in Qatar.
 But that was not before they provided some of the tournament's biggest moments and delivered the region's best-ever performance on the world stage.
 Here are five players who stood out in their countries' campaigns.
 After an opening-day defeat for Qatar against Ecuador and a 6-2 hammering for Iran at the hands of England, things were not looking promising for Saudi Arabia when they lined up to face South American giants Argentina.
 Lionel Messi duly put the two-time world champions ahead with an early penalty, and in the 27th minute, Lautaro Martinez appeared to have doubled their lead.
 For a moment, it seemed like the match would be reduced to a matter of how many goals Argentina could score. But things can change very quickly in football.
 Martinez's goal was disallowed by VAR, and just after half-time, Saleh Al-Shehri snuck the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez from a difficult angle to draw the Saudis level.
 And so the stage was set for Salem Al-Dawsari.
 Controlling the ball smartly on the edge of the box in the 53rd minute, the Al-Hilal winger dazzled the Argentinian defence with his footwork before unleashing a strike goalward.
 Emiliano Martinez got a hand to the ball, but could not stop it from finding the back of the net.
 Al-Dawsari sprinted off, celebrating the goal with a cartwheel and a backflip to cap off one of the World Cup's most jaw-dropping moments.
 Saudi Arabia's 2-1 win set the stage for what would turn out to be a tournament of upsets, as their fans marched on with the rallying cry: "Where is Messi?"
 Unfortunately for the Green Falcons, this would be the high point of their campaign. They exited the tournament in the group stage after a 2-0 loss to Poland and a 2-1 loss to Mexico.
 Al-Dawsari, however, added to his tally with the consolation goal in the final fixture – a goal that ended Mexico's hopes of surviving the group.

 Many Japanese players had their moments at this World Cup.
 Despite being somewhat culpable for goals scored by Germany and Costa Rica, goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda also supplied heroics when called upon, memorably saving four shots on goal within about 20 seconds against the Germans.
 There was Takuma Asano, who lashed the winner past Manuel Neuer's near post in what was perhaps the moment that made Samurai Blue fans realise this team was something special.
 There was Daizen Maeda, who was a constant thorn in the side for opposing defences, and was finally rewarded with a goal against Croatia.
 And, of course, no one will forget Ao Tanaka and Kaoru Mitoma proving that seeing sometimes isn't believing as they combined to complete Japan's comeback against Spain and send them into the round of 16 as group winners.
 But if one player's contributions mattered most, they were those of Ritsu Doan, who netted the equalisers against both Germany and Spain – against Germany, a simple tap-in, and against Spain, a strike lashed in with too much venom for goalkeeper Unai Simon to handle.
 The two goals were building blocks for Japan's campaign. And the Freiburg winger even had a hand in Tanaka's goal, providing the cross that appeared to go out of play until VAR showed otherwise.
 He was also involved in Maeda's opener against Croatia, as Japan edged towards the quarter-finals.
 But it was not to be, as an Ivan Perisic equaliser sent the tie into extra time and eventually penalties, where Japan fell 3-1.

 Iran did have a couple of good moments against England, and they were both provided by striker Mehdi Taremi.
 The Porto man smashed one goal past Jordan Pickford to make it 4-1, and later won and converted a penalty late in added time to lend a little more respectability to the scoreline.
 He would be in the thick of things again against Wales.
 Needing at least a draw to avoid crashing out of the World Cup after two matches, Iran came out with guns blazing.
 They had a goal disallowed in the 15th minute, and early in the second half saw two efforts clatter off the posts of the Welsh goal within about 10 seconds. 
 As the game looked to be fizzling out into a goalless draw, Taremi made a threatening run onto a long ball forward that drew out Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.
 Hennessey floored Taremi dangerously and became the first player sent off at this year's World Cup.
 Taremi, fortunately, did not look worse for wear, and in injury time, Iran seized their opportunity.
 Rouzbeh Cheshmi struck first in the eighth minute of added time, putting Iran 1-0 up with a thunderous effort from outside the box.
 And then there was Taremi again.
 In the 11th minute of added time, he picked up the ball inside his own half to start a counterattack against the undermanned Welsh and ran with it before offloading it to Ramin Rezaeian.
 Rezaeian calmly dinked the ball over substitute goalkeeper Danny Ward to seal the victory.
 Iran ultimately missed out on qualification for the round of 16 after a 1-0 loss against the United States, but finished a creditable third in their group.

 Expectations have generally been low for Australia at World Cups since their golden generation of 2006. And indeed, they arrived in Qatar on the back of three consecutive group-stage exits and just one win since 2010.
 Their opening 4-1 loss to France did not inspire much hope that this year would be any different, but the tie did start with a moment of joy for them as they took the lead with a strike from Craig Goodwin.
 The cross to Goodwin was supplied by Mathew Leckie, and the Melbourne City forward would soon find himself at the centre of Australia's journey.
 A hard-fought win against Tunisia put Australia in a great position to make it to the round of 16, but with the North African side leading 1-0 against France with an hour gone in the final group games, the Socceroos were on their way out on goal difference as they sat deadlocked with Denmark.
 Up stepped Leckie.
 Racing forward from well inside his own half, he latched on to a long ball from Riley McGree and bamboozled Joakim Maehle before sliding the ball past Kasper Schmeichel.
 Australia made it to the round of 16 for just the second time in their history, where they put up a spirited fight against Argentina in a 2-1 loss.

 He might not have appeared on the scoresheet in Qatar, but South Korean captain Son Heung-min played a key supporting role from behind his protective face mask.
 In South Korea's agonising 3-2 loss to Ghana, he was involved in both of Cho Gue-sung's goals as his side briefly drew level from two goals down.
 Down 1-0 to Portugal in a do-or-die final group game, South Korea gave themselves hope in the 27th minute as Kim Young-gwon capitalised on a Cristiano Ronaldo error to draw them level.
 A draw would not have been enough, but as the clocked ticked past the 90-minute mark, Son delivered the kind of magic that has seen him cement his place as one of the Premier League's biggest stars.
 Starting a run from just outside his own penalty area after a Portugal corner, Son collected the ball and launched a counterattack that saw him take on three defenders.
 He then threaded the ball through the backline and found a charging Hwang Hee-chan who blasted South Korea into the last 16.
 It was almost as close as they come, with South Korea progressing on goals scored after they finished level on points and goal difference with Uruguay.
 Their progression meant that Asia would have three teams in the knockout stage of a World Cup for the first time.
 A round of 16 clash with Brazil would, unsurprisingly, prove to be a bridge too far for Son and his side, as the favourites turned the tie into a dance party.
 But South Korea would at least have the final word as Paik Seung-ho thumped the ball home from distance in the 76th minute.
 And with that, a memorable outing for Asian football came to an end.

 SINGAPORE: ComfortDelGro on Thursday (Dec 8) announced that Mr Cheng Siak Kian will take over as its managing director and group CEO with effect from Jan 1 next year.
 He will succeed Mr Yang Ban Seng, who has helmed the group for the past five-and-a-half years, ComfortDelGro said in a media release.
 Mr Cheng, 53, is currently the group CEO of ComfortDelGro subsidiary SBS Transit and has been serving as ComfortDelGro's group deputy CEO since March. He will relinquish both positions when he takes on his new role.
 In a separate media release on Thursday, SBS Transit announced that Mr Jeffrey Sim Vee Ming would succeed Mr Cheng as its group CEO, also with effect from Jan 1, 2023.
 Mr Sim, 46, is currently the CEO of SBS Transit's rail business and will continue to hold this position.
 ComfortDelGro group chief financial officer Derek Koh, meanwhile, will take up the role of group deputy CEO while retaining his current position.
 In a statement on his appointment, Mr Cheng paid tribute to Mr Yang, 66.
 "Ban Seng steered the group through some really difficult times. He has done a truly commendable job ensuring jobs are kept safe whilst navigating the many challenges, especially in the last two years," he said.
 "The baton is now passing onto me to build upon that growth momentum."
 Mr Cheng also looked ahead to growth opportunities for ComfortDelGro under his leadership.
 "With the support of our people, I am confident that we will continue to broaden and deepen our capabilities," Mr Cheng said.
 "The bus and taxi businesses will continue to be our main engines of growth, but we hope to add rail services as a strong third leg as we expand overseas. As we grow our business, we will also build upon the inroads we have made in the field of sustainability."
 Mr Sim also looked ahead to opportunities for growth.
 "I am very honoured by the trust that has been placed in me to lead SBS Transit to its next phase of growth in an extremely challenging environment," said the statement. 
 "I have big shoes to fill but I am determined and together with the resolute and passionate people at SBS Transit, and the strong support of the union, we will build on our strengths to scale new heights to make every journey sustainable and a delight for our passengers."

      Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has agreed to testify before the Senate Banking Committee next week as questions and confusion swirl about the collapse of his companies.
  
 
      On Friday, he tweeted that he's âwilling to testify on [December] 13thâ  and said he will âtry to be helpful, and to shed what like I canâ about several of lawmakers' concerns, including FTX US' solvency, âpathwaysâ that could return âvalueâ to users, what he thinks about what led to the crash, and, finally, his âown failings.â
  
 
      âI had thought of myself as a model CEO, who wouldn't become lazy or disconnected,â Bankman-Fried wrote on Twitter. âWhich made it that much more destructive when I did. I'm sorry. Hopefully people can learn from the difference between who I was and who I could have been.â
  
 
      His tweets are in response to a demand from several members of Congress who demanded testimony.
  
 
      Democratic chairman Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania have asked him to appear because âsignificant unanswered questionsâ surrounding the collapse of FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, both of which filed for bankruptcy on November 11.
  
 
      âYou must answer for the failure of both entities that was caused, at least in part, by the clear misuse of client funds and wiped out billions of dollars owed to over a million creditors,â the senators wrote.
  
 
      Initially, It wasn't clear whether Bankman-Fried would comply. Bankman-Fried had tweeted Sunday that he felt he had a âduty to appear before the committee and explain,â but he was unsure of the timing.
  
 
      Separately, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, both Democrats, sent letters to three regulators â the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency â asking them to assess the traditional banking system's exposure to turmoil in the crypto space, a largely unregulated, parallel financial system.
  
 
      âCrypto firms may have closer ties to the banking system than previously understood,â Warren and Smith wrote. âBanks' relationships with crypto firms raise questions about the safety and soundness of our banking system and highlight potential loopholes that crypto firms may try to exploit to gain further access.â
  
 
      Federal prosecutors are investigating the collapse of FTX, an exchange that marketed itself as a beginner-friendly way to get involved in what was, until recently, a booming if highly volatile market for digital assets. FTX also facilitated high-risk leveraged trading that wasn't allowed inside the United States. (The firm was based in The Bahamas.)
  
 
      FTX was one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world until last month, when it faced a sudden wave of customer withdrawals that it couldn't cover. One of the key questions prosecutors are likely to probe is whether FTX misappropriated customer funds when it made loans to Alameda.
  
 
      Bankman-Fried has denied accusations of misusing customer deposits. âI didn't knowingly commingle funds,â he told The New York Times last week. âI was frankly surprised by how big Alameda's position was.â
  
 
      Federal prosecutors are also investigating whether Bankman-Fried played a role in the collapse this spring of two interlinked cryptocurrencies, Terra and Luna, according to the New York Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter.
  
 
      The Times said the issue is part of a broadening inquiry into the collapse of FTX, and it's not clear whether prosecutors have determined any wrongdoing by Bankman-Fried.
  
 
      In a statement to the paper, Bankman-Fried said he was ânot aware of any market manipulation and certainly never intended to engage in market manipulation.â

      The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday with defrauding investors and customers in his failed crypto exchange FTX.
  
 
      The SEC said Bankman-Fried, âorchestrated a years-long fraudâ to conceal from FTX investors the diversion of customer funds to Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. 
  
 
      âWe allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,â SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.
  
 
      Regulators signaled this may be just the first of multiple charges to come. The SEC said there are ongoing investigations into âother securities law violationsâ and into other entities and individuals. The agency added that another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is also charging Bankman-Fried. 
  
 
      Bankman-Fried's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.
  
 
      Known as âSBF,â Bankman-Fried is the 30-year-old crypto celebrity who became a pariah overnight last month as his company suffered a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy, leaving at least a million depositors unable to access their funds. He was arrested without incident at his Bahamas apartment complex shortly after 6 pm ET Monday, and is set to appear in a Nassau court Tuesday, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said Monday in a statement. 
  
 
      FTX achieved a $32 billion valuation by raising more than $1.8 billion since launching in May 2019, including from sophisticated investors such as BlackRock, Sequoia Capital and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Star athletes and celebrities who backed FTX also reportedly received a stake in the company, including Tom Brady and Gisele.  
  
 
      The SEC alleges that Bankman-Fried, 30, duped those investors who backed FTX by promoting it as a âsafe, responsibleâ crypto trading firm that used âsophisticated, automatedâ risk measures to protect customer funds.
  
 
      In reality, the complaint alleges, Bankman-Fried secretly diverted FTX customer funds to effectively provide an âunlimited âline of credit'â to Alameda. The SEC says Bankman-Fried further concealed from investors the risk stemming from FTX's exposure to significant holdings of overvalued, illiquid assets such as FTX-related tokens. 
  
 
      Bankman-Fried didn't just use the FTX customer funds to make risky bets at his hedge fund. The SEC alleges he used that money to make undisclosed venture investments, make âlavishâ real estate purchases and large political donations. 
  
 
      âFTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr. Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary ârisk engine,' and FTX's adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service,â Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said in a statement. âBut as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn't just thin, it was fraudulent.â
  
 
      In the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX's customers. 
  
 
      âI didn't knowingly commit fraud,â he told the BBC over the weekend. âI didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.â
  
 
      But Bankman-Fried has previously admitting making mistakes while leading FTX, which he stepped down from last month after it filed for bankruptcy.
  
 
      âLook, I screwed up,â Bankman-Fried said during a virtual appearance at the New York Times' DealBook Summit. âThere are things I would do anything to do over.â

 Russia's war in Ukraine
 By Kathleen Magramo, Jack Guy and Adrienne Vogt, CNN
 From CNN’s Marguerite Lacroix and Allegra Goodwin
 
 
 More than one billion dollars was pledged to support Ukraine during a bleak winter at a conference in Paris Tuesday, France’s foreign minister said.
 The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organizations, will be split between restoring Ukraine’s depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna told the conference, adding that $520 million of funding was yet to be allocated. 
 The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for $843 million in aid in a virtual address to delegates at the conference, as millions of Ukrainians face a freezing winter under the shadow of Russia’s war, without access to electricity, water and central heating.

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has appointed Sergei Aleinik as new foreign minister, state news agency Belta reported Tuesday.
 Prior to this appointment, Aleinik worked in the foreign ministry as first deputy minister.
 Belarus’ previous longstanding foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, died suddenly in November at the age of 64.
 Lukashenko also appointed Andrei Lukyanovich as commander of the Air Force and Air Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus, Belta said.
 Belarus earlier on Tuesday announced snap military drills across the country.

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked world leaders gathered at a conference in Paris for more aid to help his country survive Russian attacks on critical infrastructure this winter. 
 Meanwhile, a key bridge used to resupply Russian forces occupying the city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine has been targeted.
 Here are the latest headlines:

 A bridge essential to the resupply of Russian forces occupying the city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine was targeted by strikes overnight, according to both Ukrainian and Russian officials. 
 The bridge appears to have buckled or collapsed inwards in a video posted online by Vladimir Rogov, a pro-Russian regional official.
 Rogov also posted what appears to be CCTV footage in which an explosion can be heard.
 CNN has not been able to verify if the explosion is from the bridge, but the video is part of a set of videos Rogov posted of the incident. 
 Ivan Fedorov, the exiled Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, said that the route is "one of the strategically important bridges."
 Rogov also suggested that the bridge is a vital supply route for "food, medicine and building materials to the liberated territories of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions."
 The bridge connects the city of Melitopol to a suburb named Konstantynivka. It is part of the M14 highway, which runs along Ukraine’s southern coastline from Melitopol to Berdiansk and Mariupol to the east before reaching the Russian Federation.

 Ukraine needs to appreciate that Moscow has added new territories to the Russian Federation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s three-step proposal for peace.
 "The Ukrainian side needs to take into account the realities that have developed over all this time," Peskov told reporters on a regular conference call. 
 "And these realities indicate that the Russian Federation has new subjects [the four annexed territories]."
 "Without taking these new realities into account, any progress is impossible," he added.
 In a video statement to the G7 leaders Monday, Zelensky asked to "preserve this level of solidarity" and support Ukraine next year, outlining three steps for peace. 
 The final step outlined by Zelensky was a "new diplomacy" that involved a peace solution asking Russia to start withdrawing troops from Ukraine this Christmas.

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for $843 million in aid to support the country's critical infrastructure this winter. 
 In a virtual address at a conference in Paris, Zelensky said Ukraine required critical electrical infrastructure, as well as urgent imports of electricity from European countries "at least until the end of the heating season."
 "This will cost about 800 million euros ... but the price is less than the cost of the blackout," he warned. 
 Russia has been repeatedly accused of using "winter as a weapon of war" in Ukraine in recent weeks, relentlessly striking critical infrastructure and leaving millions of Ukrainians without access to electricity, water and central heating in freezing temperatures. 
 The 46 countries and 24 international organizations which gathered in Paris on Tuesday are expected to commit to providing immediate support to Ukraine, focusing on the winter period.
 France will commit an additional $80.7 million of humanitarian aid, according to a statement from President Emmanuel Macron’s office, of which $51.1 million will be dedicated to energy, access to water, food, health and transport infrastructure, as well as demining operations. 
 This will include 63 new high-powered electrical generators being provided to Ukraine in the very near future, the statement said. 
 So far the conference has seen $421.6 million committed to Ukraine, the statement said, adding that the figure is expected to increase.  
 From CNN's Jessie Gretener in London
 
 
 Hundreds of generators are on their way to Ukraine, said President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, adding that "in these times of suffering and darkness, it is so important to bring light to Ukraine."
 A total of 800 generators are being distributed across Ukraine, including 40 large generators supplied to ensure uninterrupted power supply to 30 hospitals in the regions of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Kherson, said von der Leyen.
 It is vital to keep the Ukrainian power grid functioning despite Russian strikes, said von der Leyen at a Solidarity of the Ukrainian people conference in Paris on Tuesday morning.
 The European Union is working on increasing the amount of electricity which can be traded between Ukraine, Moldova and the rest of Europe, she added.
 Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska sat alongside von der Leyen and spoke about the challenges her country is facing, including damage to infrastructure. 
 Zelenska thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for hosting the forum and asked allies to "become more than you have been before."

 Three people were killed and a further 15 injured in shelling in the city of Kherson on Monday, according to the head of the Ukrainian regional military administration. 
 "Russian occupiers shelled the territory of Kherson region 57 times," said Yaroslav Yanushevych on Telegram. 
 "Peaceful settlements of the region were shelled with artillery, MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket Systems) and mortars."
 Schools, a stadium, medical facilities, power lines and infrastructure points, as well as residential buildings were all targeted, he added.
 From CNN’s Anna Chernova
 The Russian town of Klintsy in the Bryansk region has been shelled overnight by Ukrainian troops, said regional governor Alexander Bogomaz.
 Air defense systems destroyed the missile, Bogomaz said in a Telegram post on Tuesday, and some parts of it "fell into the territory of the industrial zone."
 "There were no casualties or damage," he added.
 Klintsy is located in western Russia, around 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The closest Ukrainian city is Chernihiv.
