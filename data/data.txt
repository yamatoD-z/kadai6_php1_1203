 In a tumultuous year for investors, sharp rises in interest rates, macro volatility and a sustained selloff in equity markets have kept them on their toes. But a new investment paradigm is emerging, and many investors are looking beyond traditional asset classes for portfolio diversification.
 In Japan, Credit Suisse has worked with clients to deliver an impressive array of solutions with which to adapt to changing market conditions.
 One of many striking examples from the past year was the launch of a new fund, which offers a new way for sophisticated individuals to invest in private equity.
 In Japan’s ultra-low interest rate environment, there is increasing interest in alternative assets, such as venture capital. But, thanks to a range of technical hurdles, the asset class has traditionally been accessible only to institutional investors.
 The Daiwa WiL Ventures III, LP Fund is designed to overcome these hurdles for individual investors.
 “This is the first solution in the Japanese market allowing retail investors to invest in US and Japan private equity as far as we are aware,” says Ryosuke Ishizawa, head of investment solutions sales in Japan. “Diversification with traditional assets hasn’t worked well in this year’s market environment. So alternative investments might be a good portfolio-diversification candidate, but alternative investments tend to be limited to institutional or pension clients, due to the complexity.”
 Launching a public fund that could be offered to individual investors demands some out-of-the-box thinking. First, investors are required to fund the product upfront, to deal with the capital calls that investors are required to make on-demand when investing in private equity. The upfront funding is then fed into certain liquidity management products to maintain the overall yield.
 And to make the fund liquid enough to be considered a public fund under Japanese regulation, special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) were used, alongside an arrangement with a liquidity provider. Credit Suisse’s strong track record in SPV issuance make it well placed to deliver the solution.
 “Because of securing that liquidity, the fund structure is no longer regarded as an illiquid investment. That is why we can bring this fund to Japan to sell to a larger investor base,” he says.
 The fund, which comes with a minimum ticket size of $1 million, has been a huge hit with investors since its launch in May.
 “I think it’s a good example of how we can articulate different platforms and make a combination that brings value to the client,” says Romain Barba, head of equity derivatives and investment solutions structuring in Japan. “We intend to repeat this structure over the coming years, potentially with larger capacity.”
 Another novel structure Credit Suisse is offering to Japanese investors for the first time this year is the operational risk bond.
 While Credit Suisse has been issuing operational risk bonds elsewhere since 2016, the 2022 vintage has some revised features – such as a new spread – corresponding to the current op risk environment. The idea is simple, yet innovative. Credit Suisse takes out an operational risk insurance policy – covering risks such as losses from system disruptions or legal and compliance issues – and then uses an SPV to securitise and sell the bonds to investors in the capital markets.
 The bonds’ investors start to lose money if the bank suffers losses of more than $3.5 billion in the space of a year. Historically, however, Credit Suisse’s operational losses have been in the order of $100 million–200 million, meaning previous investors in the bonds have suffered no impairment.
 The bonds are attractive to both the bank and its investors. For the bank, it offers a means to lower the amount of capital needed to set aside for operational risk losses. For investors, it offers an investment product with a very attractive coupon – typically 3-month rate plus 4.5%, or more – which, importantly, in the current market environment, is independent of moves in other financial assets.
 “There’s no correlation with credit, and there’s no correlation with market parameters,” says Go Matsui, head of leading financial institutions solutions sales in Japan at Credit Suisse. “It is a unique type of risk, and something we have not marketed to investors in Japan before.”
 Interest from Japanese investors in the bonds has been very strong, illustrating continued interest for a transaction offering exposure to attractive yield and a unique risk, as well as confidence in Credit Suisse’s risk management capabilities in the current environment.
 The bonds are a “win-win” for both the bank and investors, Matsui says.
 “Investors are able to get attractive yield compared to its risk,” he says. “And because of the capital we need to hold against this type of risk, we can pay this spread of 4.5% over a three-month rate.”
 Some Japanese institutions have been so impressed they are even making enquiries to Credit Suisse about the structure, with a view to potentially doing something similar.
 “The feedback we’ve had from investors in Japan is quite encouraging,” says Barba. “They are interested in it not only from a risk-return perspective. They are also interested in the structure and mechanism of these bonds so that they can control their operational risk. That shows you how innovative this structure is.”
 In the past year, Credit Suisse has also broken new ground in sustainability finance with its work as the sole structurer and arranger on the world’s largest blue-bond financing for the government of Belize. The firm’s placement of this structured debt with Japanese investors was key to the deal’s success.
 The yield on Belize’s borrowing was previously very high and was pushing it towards a debt crisis. Marine ecosystems are, meanwhile, important to the country’s ecotourism industry, and especially the economic prosperity of its coastal areas.
 Credit Suisse teamed up with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organisation headquartered in Virginia, USA, to structure a sustainable financing solution for the country.
 Through the bond, announced last November, Belize was able to restructure the entirety of its debt at a lower interest rate. The proceeds reduced Belize’s overall external indebtedness by roughly 12% of gross domestic product, while generating an estimated $180 million for conservation.
 “What that means is that firstly an emerging market country is no longer having to waste so much of its budget paying off this debt, but also the money can be freed up to be used to invest in cleaning up the ocean,” says Shigeyuki Takahashi, head of cross-asset structuring in Japan at Credit Suisse.
 The firm achieved this impressive outcome by leveraging its structuring expertise, market-leading repackaging technology and a network of Japanese investor clients.
 The blue bond is a $364 million amortising 19-year fixed rate instrument, issued by an SPV and secured by a loan to Belize Blue Investment Company, a subsidiary of TNC.
 The loan is insured by the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and on the strength of that insurance policy, the bonds received an Aa2 credit rating from Moody’s.
 The bank opened the syndication of blue bonds to a select group of Japanese investors, offering the investment in various currencies and a clean note format, through repackaged transactions. A large block of the bonds was taken up by a single Japanese insurance company.
 “We have two SPVs and one SPV issuing the note and then using the proceeds of [that] note the SPV is [then] making a loan to another SPV,” says Takahashi. “We then worked with the DFC in providing insurance for that loan, which could provide more favourable financial conditions to Belize.”
 “The beauty of this structure is that we have a good possibility to replicate the same structure or similar structure for other sovereigns,” he says. “We’re expecting to do similar transactions for other sovereigns in the future.”

 In a tumultuous year for investors, sharp rises in interest rates, macro volatility and a sustained selloff in equity markets have kept them on their toes. But a new investment paradigm is emerging, and many investors are looking beyond traditional asset classes for portfolio diversification.
 In Japan, Credit Suisse has worked with clients to deliver an impressive array of solutions with which to adapt to changing market conditions.

Credit Suisse takes out an operational risk insurance policy – covering risks such as losses from system disruptions or legal and compliance issues – and then uses an SPV to securitise and sell the bonds to investors in the capital markets.
 The bonds’ investors start to lose money if the bank suffers losses of more than $3.5 billion in the space of a year. Historically, however, Credit Suisse’s operational losses have been in the order of $100 million–200 million, meaning previous investors in the bonds have suffered no impairment.
 The bonds are attractive to both the bank and its investors. For the bank, it offers a means to lower the amount of capital needed to set aside for operational risk losses. For investors, it offers an investment product with a very attractive coupon – typically 3-month rate plus 4.5%, or more – which, importantly, in the current market environment, is independent of moves in other financial assets.
 “There’s no correlation with credit, and there’s no correlation with market parameters,” says Go Matsui, head of leading financial institutions solutions sales in Japan at Credit Suisse. “It is a unique type of risk, and something we have not marketed to investors in Japan before.”
 Interest from Japanese investors in the bonds has been very strong, illustrating continued interest for a transaction offering exposure to attractive yield and a unique risk, as well as confidence in Credit Suisse’s risk management capabilities in the current environment.
 The bonds are a “win-win” for both the bank and investors, Matsui says.
 “Investors are able to get attractive yield compared to its risk,” he says. “And because of the capital we need to hold against this type of risk, we can pay this spread of 4.5% over a three-month rate.”
 Some Japanese institutions have been so impressed they are even making enquiries to Credit Suisse about the structure, with a view to potentially doing something similar.
 “The feedback we’ve had from investors in Japan is quite encouraging,” says Barba. “They are interested in it not only from a risk-return perspective. They are also interested in the structure and mechanism of these bonds so that they can control their operational risk. That shows you how innovative this structure is.”
 In the past year, Credit Suisse has also broken new ground in sustainability finance with its work as the sole structurer and arranger on the world’s largest blue-bond financing for the government of Belize. The firm’s placement of this structured debt with Japanese investors was key to the deal’s success.
 The yield on Belize’s borrowing was previously very high and was pushing it towards a debt crisis. Marine ecosystems are, meanwhile, important to the country’s ecotourism industry, and especially the economic prosperity of its coastal areas.
 Credit Suisse teamed up with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organisation headquartered in Virginia, USA, to structure a sustainable financing solution for the country.
 Through the bond, announced last November, Belize was able to restructure the entirety of its debt at a lower interest rate. The proceeds reduced Belize’s overall external indebtedness by roughly 12% of gross domestic product, while generating an estimated $180 million for conservation.
 “What that means is that firstly an emerging market country is no longer having to waste so much of its budget paying off this debt, but also the money can be freed up to be used to invest in cleaning up the ocean,” says Shigeyuki Takahashi, head of cross-asset structuring in Japan at Credit Suisse.
 The firm achieved this impressive outcome by leveraging its structuring expertise, market-leading repackaging technology and a network of Japanese investor clients.
 The blue bond is a $364 million amortising 19-year fixed rate instrument, issued by an SPV and secured by a loan to Belize Blue Investment Company, a subsidiary of TNC.
 The loan is insured by the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and on the strength of that insurance policy, the bonds received an Aa2 credit rating from Moody’s.
 The bank opened the syndication of blue bonds to a select group of Japanese investors, offering the investment in various currencies and a clean note format, through repackaged transactions. A large block of the bonds was taken up by a single Japanese insurance company.
 “We have two SPVs and one SPV issuing the note and then using the proceeds of [that] note the SPV is [then] making a loan to another SPV,” says Takahashi. “We then worked with the DFC in providing insurance for that loan, which could provide more favourable financial conditions to Belize.”
 “The beauty of this structure is that we have a good possibility to replicate the same structure or similar structure for other sovereigns,” he says. “We’re expecting to do similar transactions for other sovereigns in the future.”

 In a tumultuous year for investors, sharp rises in interest rates, macro volatility and a sustained selloff in equity markets have kept them on their toes. But a new investment paradigm is emerging, and many investors are looking beyond traditional asset classes for portfolio diversification.
 In Japan, Credit Suisse has worked with clients to deliver an impressive array of solutions with which to adapt to changing market conditions.
 One of many striking examples from the past year was the launch of a new fund, which offers a new way for sophisticated individuals to invest in private equity.
 In Japan’s ultra-low interest rate environment, there is increasing interest in alternative assets, such as venture capital. But, thanks to a range of technical hurdles, the asset class has traditionally been accessible only to institutional investors.
 The Daiwa WiL Ventures III, LP Fund is designed to overcome these hurdles for individual investors.
 “This is the first solution in the Japanese market allowing retail investors to invest in US and Japan private equity as far as we are aware,” says Ryosuke Ishizawa, head of investment solutions sales in Japan. “Diversification with traditional assets hasn’t worked well in this year’s market environment. So alternative investments might be a good portfolio-diversification candidate, but alternative investments tend to be limited to institutional or pension clients, due to the complexity.”
 Launching a public fund that could be offered to individual investors demands some out-of-the-box thinking. First, investors are required to fund the product upfront, to deal with the capital calls that investors are required to make on-demand when investing in private equity. The upfront funding is then fed into certain liquidity management products to maintain the overall yield.
 And to make the fund liquid enough to be considered a public fund under Japanese regulation, special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) were used, alongside an arrangement with a liquidity provider. Credit Suisse’s strong track record in SPV issuance make it well placed to deliver the solution.
 “Because of securing that liquidity, the fund structure is no longer regarded as an illiquid investment. That is why we can bring this fund to Japan to sell to a larger investor base,” he says.
 The fund, which comes with a minimum ticket size of $1 million, has been a huge hit with investors since its launch in May.
 “I think it’s a good example of how we can articulate different platforms and make a combination that brings value to the client,” says Romain Barba, head of equity derivatives and investment solutions structuring in Japan. “We intend to repeat this structure over the coming years, potentially with larger capacity.”
 Another novel structure Credit Suisse is offering to Japanese investors for the first time this year is the operational risk bond.
 While Credit Suisse has been issuing operational risk bonds elsewhere since 2016, the 2022 vintage has some revised features – such as a new spread – corresponding to the current op risk environment.

 In the past year, Credit Suisse has also broken new ground in sustainability finance with its work as the sole structurer and arranger on the world’s largest blue-bond financing for the government of Belize. The firm’s placement of this structured debt with Japanese investors was key to the deal’s success.
 The yield on Belize’s borrowing was previously very high and was pushing it towards a debt crisis. Marine ecosystems are, meanwhile, important to the country’s ecotourism industry, and especially the economic prosperity of its coastal areas.
 Credit Suisse teamed up with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organisation headquartered in Virginia, USA, to structure a sustainable financing solution for the country.

 The loan is insured by the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and on the strength of that insurance policy, the bonds received an Aa2 credit rating from Moody’s.
 The bank opened the syndication of blue bonds to a select group of Japanese investors, offering the investment in various currencies and a clean note format, through repackaged transactions. A large block of the bonds was taken up by a single Japanese insurance company.
 “We have two SPVs and one SPV issuing the note and then using the proceeds of [that] note the SPV is [then] making a loan to another SPV,” says Takahashi. “We then worked with the DFC in providing insurance for that loan, which could provide more favourable financial conditions to Belize.”
 “The beauty of this structure is that we have a good possibility to replicate the same structure or similar structure for other sovereigns,” he says. “We’re expecting to do similar transactions for other sovereigns in the future.”

 In a tumultuous year for investors, sharp rises in interest rates, macro volatility and a sustained selloff in equity markets have kept them on their toes. But a new investment paradigm is emerging, and many investors are looking beyond traditional asset classes for portfolio diversification.
 In Japan, Credit Suisse has worked with clients to deliver an impressive array of solutions with which to adapt to changing market conditions.
 One of many striking examples from the past year was the launch of a new fund, which offers a new way for sophisticated individuals to invest in private equity.
 In Japan’s ultra-low interest rate environment, there is increasing interest in alternative assets, such as venture capital. But, thanks to a range of technical hurdles, the asset class has traditionally been accessible only to institutional investors.
 The Daiwa WiL Ventures III, LP Fund is designed to overcome these hurdles for individual investors.
 “This is the first solution in the Japanese market allowing retail investors to invest in US and Japan private equity as far as we are aware,” says Ryosuke Ishizawa, head of investment solutions sales in Japan. “Diversification with traditional assets hasn’t worked well in this year’s market environment. So alternative investments might be a good portfolio-diversification candidate, but alternative investments tend to be limited to institutional or pension clients, due to the complexity.”
 Launching a public fund that could be offered to individual investors demands some out-of-the-box thinking. First, investors are required to fund the product upfront, to deal with the capital calls that investors are required to make on-demand when investing in private equity. The upfront funding is then fed into certain liquidity management products to maintain the overall yield.
 And to make the fund liquid enough to be considered a public fund under Japanese regulation, special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) were used, alongside an arrangement with a liquidity provider. Credit Suisse’s strong track record in SPV issuance make it well placed to deliver the solution.
 “Because of securing that liquidity, the fund structure is no longer regarded as an illiquid investment. That is why we can bring this fund to Japan to sell to a larger investor base,” he says.
 The fund, which comes with a minimum ticket size of $1 million, has been a huge hit with investors since its launch in May.
 “I think it’s a good example of how we can articulate different platforms and make a combination that brings value to the client,” says Romain Barba, head of equity derivatives and investment solutions structuring in Japan. “We intend to repeat this structure over the coming years, potentially with larger capacity.”
 Another novel structure Credit Suisse is offering to Japanese investors for the first time this year is the operational risk bond.
 While Credit Suisse has been issuing operational risk bonds elsewhere since 2016, the 2022 vintage has some revised features – such as a new spread – corresponding to the current op risk environment. The idea is simple, yet innovative. Credit Suisse takes out an operational risk insurance policy – covering risks such as losses from system disruptions or legal and compliance issues – and then uses an SPV to securitise and sell the bonds to investors in the capital markets.
 The bonds’ investors start to lose money if the bank suffers losses of more than $3.5 billion in the space of a year. Historically, however, Credit Suisse’s operational losses have been in the order of $100 million–200 million, meaning previous investors in the bonds have suffered no impairment.
 The bonds are attractive to both the bank and its investors. For the bank, it offers a means to lower the amount of capital needed to set aside for operational risk losses. For investors, it offers an investment product with a very attractive coupon – typically 3-month rate plus 4.5%, or more – which, importantly, in the current market environment, is independent of moves in other financial assets.
 “There’s no correlation with credit, and there’s no correlation with market parameters,” says Go Matsui, head of leading financial institutions solutions sales in Japan at Credit Suisse. “It is a unique type of risk, and something we have not marketed to investors in Japan before.”
 Interest from Japanese investors in the bonds has been very strong, illustrating continued interest for a transaction offering exposure to attractive yield and a unique risk, as well as confidence in Credit Suisse’s risk management capabilities in the current environment.
 The bonds are a “win-win” for both the bank and investors, Matsui says.
 “Investors are able to get attractive yield compared to its risk,” he says. “And because of the capital we need to hold against this type of risk, we can pay this spread of 4.5% over a three-month rate.”
 Some Japanese institutions have been so impressed they are even making enquiries to Credit Suisse about the structure, with a view to potentially doing something similar.
 “The feedback we’ve had from investors in Japan is quite encouraging,” says Barba. “They are interested in it not only from a risk-return perspective. They are also interested in the structure and mechanism of these bonds so that they can control their operational risk. That shows you how innovative this structure is.”
 In the past year, Credit Suisse has also broken new ground in sustainability finance with its work as the sole structurer and arranger on the world’s largest blue-bond financing for the government of Belize. The firm’s placement of this structured debt with Japanese investors was key to the deal’s success.
 The yield on Belize’s borrowing was previously very high and was pushing it towards a debt crisis. Marine ecosystems are, meanwhile, important to the country’s ecotourism industry, and especially the economic prosperity of its coastal areas.
 Credit Suisse teamed up with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organisation headquartered in Virginia, USA, to structure a sustainable financing solution for the country.
 Through the bond, announced last November, Belize was able to restructure the entirety of its debt at a lower interest rate. The proceeds reduced Belize’s overall external indebtedness by roughly 12% of gross domestic product, while generating an estimated $180 million for conservation.
 “What that means is that firstly an emerging market country is no longer having to waste so much of its budget paying off this debt, but also the money can be freed up to be used to invest in cleaning up the ocean,” says Shigeyuki Takahashi, head of cross-asset structuring in Japan at Credit Suisse.
 The firm achieved this impressive outcome by leveraging its structuring expertise, market-leading repackaging technology and a network of Japanese investor clients.
 The blue bond is a $364 million amortising 19-year fixed rate instrument, issued by an SPV and secured by a loan to Belize Blue Investment Company, a subsidiary of TNC.
 The loan is insured by the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and on the strength of that insurance policy, the bonds received an Aa2 credit rating from Moody’s.

      The United Kingdom faces a âlost decadeâ of growth if action isnât taken to address slumping business investment and worker shortages, a leading business lobby group has warned.
  
 
      In a bleak economic forecast published on Monday, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that three quarters of companies are struggling to find the skills and workers they need. It urged changes in government policy, including a more flexible immigration system and tax breaks to boost investment.
  
 
      âBritain is in stagflation â with rocketing inflation, negative growth, falling productivity and business investment. Firms see potential growth opportunities but a lack of âreasons to believeâ in the face of headwinds are causing them to pause investing in 2023,â CBI director general Tony Danker said in a statement. 
  
 
      âWe will see a lost decade of growth if action isnât taken. GDP is a simple multiplier of two factors: people and their productivity. But we donât have people we need, nor the productivity,â Danker added.
  
 
      The United Kingdom is the only G7 economy that still hasnât recovered fully from the pandemic. Soaring energy and food costs drove inflation to a 41-year high in October. Widespread strikes have become the norm in recent months as workers feel the sting of a worsening cost-of-living crisis.
  
 
      
      In Britain, nearly 200,000 workers are striking on Black Friday
    
 
      UK workers suffered the biggest drop in their spending power in more than 20 years between April and June as average real wages â which take inflation into account â fell by 3%. The drop in real wages was less severe in the third quarter but was still one of the largest since official records began in 2001.
  
 
      In a sign of how disruptive strike action has become, Conservative Party chairman Nadim Zahawi said Sunday that the government is looking at bringing in the military to keep public services running.
  
 
      The outlook for the UK economy next year is among the weakest of the advanced nations covered by the CBI forecast, with only German GDP set to fall at a slightly faster pace. Germany has felt the full force of the energy crisis unleashed by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.
  
 
      The CBI expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4% in 2023 â a significant downgrade from the growth of 1% it predicted in June. The economy is forecast to recover to its pre-Covid size only in the second quarter of 2024.
  
 
      Inflation should fall gradually over the coming year, but it will remain significantly above the Bank of Englandâs 2% target over 2023 and lead to a year-long decline in consumer spending, the CBI forecast.
  
 
      The group expects business investment to fall from the middle of next year, leaving it 9% below its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2024. Output per worker is expected to remain 2% below its âalready weakâ pre-Covid trend by that time, the CBI said.
  
 
      âWhile itâs some consolation that the upcoming recession will be shallow, itâs concerning that longer-term weakness in productivity and business investment appears to be bedding in,â the CBIâs lead economist, Alpesh Paleja, said in a statement. âIt does not bode well for living standards and the economyâs capacity to grow over the longer-term.â
  
 
      The group said the government should address investment shortfalls with permanent tax incentives, which it estimates will unlock an extra Â£50 billion ($61.4 billion) in capital investment per year by the end of the decade. 
  
 
      âWe cannot afford to have another decade where both [investment and productivity] are stagnant,â Danker said.

      The United Kingdom faces a âlost decadeâ of growth if action isnât taken to address slumping business investment and worker shortages, a leading business lobby group has warned.
  
 
      In a bleak economic forecast published on Monday, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that three quarters of companies are struggling to find the skills and workers they need. It urged changes in government policy, including a more flexible immigration system and tax breaks to boost investment.
  
 
      âBritain is in stagflation â with rocketing inflation, negative growth, falling productivity and business investment. Firms see potential growth opportunities but a lack of âreasons to believeâ in the face of headwinds are causing them to pause investing in 2023,â CBI director general Tony Danker said in a statement. 
  
 
      âWe will see a lost decade of growth if action isnât taken. GDP is a simple multiplier of two factors: people and their productivity. But we donât have people we need, nor the productivity,â Danker added.
  
 
      The United Kingdom is the only G7 economy that still hasnât recovered fully from the pandemic. Soaring energy and food costs drove inflation to a 41-year high in October. Widespread strikes have become the norm in recent months as workers feel the sting of a worsening cost-of-living crisis.
  
 
      
      In Britain, nearly 200,000 workers are striking on Black Friday
    
 
      UK workers suffered the biggest drop in their spending power in more than 20 years between April and June as average real wages â which take inflation into account â fell by 3%. The drop in real wages was less severe in the third quarter but was still one of the largest since official records began in 2001.
  
 
      In a sign of how disruptive strike action has become, Conservative Party chairman Nadim Zahawi said Sunday that the government is looking at bringing in the military to keep public services running.
  
 
      The outlook for the UK economy next year is among the weakest of the advanced nations covered by the CBI forecast, with only German GDP set to fall at a slightly faster pace. Germany has felt the full force of the energy crisis unleashed by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.
  
 
      The CBI expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4% in 2023 â a significant downgrade from the growth of 1% it predicted in June. The economy is forecast to recover to its pre-Covid size only in the second quarter of 2024.
  
 
      Inflation should fall gradually over the coming year, but it will remain significantly above the Bank of Englandâs 2% target over 2023 and lead to a year-long decline in consumer spending, the CBI forecast.
  
 
      The group expects business investment to fall from the middle of next year, leaving it 9% below its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2024. Output per worker is expected to remain 2% below its âalready weakâ pre-Covid trend by that time, the CBI said.
  
 
      âWhile itâs some consolation that the upcoming recession will be shallow, itâs concerning that longer-term weakness in productivity and business investment appears to be bedding in,â the CBIâs lead economist, Alpesh Paleja, said in a statement. âIt does not bode well for living standards and the economyâs capacity to grow over the longer-term.â

      The outlook for the UK economy next year is among the weakest of the advanced nations covered by the CBI forecast, with only German GDP set to fall at a slightly faster pace. Germany has felt the full force of the energy crisis unleashed by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.
  
 
      The CBI expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4% in 2023 â a significant downgrade from the growth of 1% it predicted in June. The economy is forecast to recover to its pre-Covid size only in the second quarter of 2024.
  
 
      Inflation should fall gradually over the coming year, but it will remain significantly above the Bank of Englandâs 2% target over 2023 and lead to a year-long decline in consumer spending, the CBI forecast.
  
 
      The group expects business investment to fall from the middle of next year, leaving it 9% below its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2024. Output per worker is expected to remain 2% below its âalready weakâ pre-Covid trend by that time, the CBI said.
  
 
      âWhile itâs some consolation that the upcoming recession will be shallow, itâs concerning that longer-term weakness in productivity and business investment appears to be bedding in,â the CBIâs lead economist, Alpesh Paleja, said in a statement. âIt does not bode well for living standards and the economyâs capacity to grow over the longer-term.â
  
 
      The group said the government should address investment shortfalls with permanent tax incentives, which it estimates will unlock an extra Â£50 billion ($61.4 billion) in capital investment per year by the end of the decade. 
  
 
      âWe cannot afford to have another decade where both [investment and productivity] are stagnant,â Danker said.

2022-12-06 15:12:45 Ukraine is switching to emergency shutdowns to stabilise its power grid after Monday's Russian missile attacks, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
 He said many regions were affected, and the local authorities warned that about half of the Kyiv region would remain without electricity in the coming days.
 Four people were killed in Monday's attacks.
 Overnight, more missiles hit critical infrastructure near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, officials said.
 In a separate development on Tuesday, the governor of Russia's Kursk region said a drone attack on an airfield set an oil storage tank alight.
 Video posted online shows fierce flames and dense black smoke billowing from the site.
 There were no casualties, said Roman Starovoyt, but two local schools were closed for the day. He did not say who could be behind the attack in the region that borders Ukraine.
 In Ukraine, the energy minister said he hoped to significantly reduce the power deficit caused by the latest Russian strikes by Tuesday evening, bringing nuclear power stations back onto the grid.
 The country is now seeing snow and sub-zero temperatures in many regions, and millions are without electricity and running water. There are fears that a number of people may die of hypothermia.
 In his video address late on Monday, President Zelensky said 70 Russian missiles were fired on Monday, and "most of them were shot down".
 Mr Zelensky said "the biggest number of shutdowns is in Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions", referring to regions spanning the length and breadth of the country.
 But he pledged that the authorities "will do everything to restore stability".
 The Ukrainian leader said electricity supplies were also affected in neighbouring Moldova, proving that Russia's actions were "a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region". 
 The Russian defence ministry claimed it had carried out massive high-precision strikes on Ukraine's military command and control systems, and on other targets.
 Monday's strikes were Russia's eighth massive missile attack in eight weeks, and came after days of repeated warnings that Moscow was planning the fresh assault.
 The assault eventually arrived just hours after a series of explosions at two military airfields deep inside Russia, which Moscow blamed on Ukrainian drones intercepted by Russian air-defences. 
 Three servicemen were killed and two aircraft were lightly damaged at the airfields in the Ryazan and Saratov region, the Russian defence ministry said. Ukraine has not publicly commented on the issue.
 The two airfields - hundreds of kilometres from Ukraine's border - house Russian strategic bombers that have been used to carry out missile attacks since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.
 President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of Russia's security council on Tuesday - a meeting that usually happens on Fridays.
 State TV showed a clip from his opening remarks, in which the Kremlin leader said the subject of the meeting would be state security.
 Before the latest Russian strikes, officials in Kyiv were talking about moving from highly disruptive emergency blackouts, which often last for many hours, to more manageable scheduled power cuts which offer civilians some badly needed predictability.
 Moscow has been battering Ukraine's power grid since 10 October, following a string of heavy military defeats on the battlefield.
 Some Western leaders have called the strategy a war crime, because of the huge amount of damage caused to civilian infrastructure. 
 Experts have told the BBC that Russia's tactic of hitting energy infrastructure is most likely designed to demoralise and terrorise the population, rather than gain any concrete military advantage.
 Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations.
